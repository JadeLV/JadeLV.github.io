### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about how to use strings and vectors and this was our first time being introduced to 
    them in code. I was able to write strings and vectors for the first time. It was great getting to learn how to get the code to output a response
    after inputting 3 answers that were requested by the program.

* Lab 9
    
    The entirety of lab 9 was another favorite because it was the first lab I did without any extra help besides from my partner. It was extremely
    frustrating at first because I was unable to figure out the math for part 1, once I did working on part-2 of the lab was a breeze. It was great
    getting too work on something that I enjoyed and boosted my confidence for the other labs.

* Lab 11
    
    Lab 11, part 2 was my absolute favorite because I had really enjoyed creating the Hi-Low Game in a previous lab. It was definetely one of the easier
    Labs for me to work on which was encouraging after struggling with others earlier in the semester. Lab 11 primarily focused on creating a more complex
    version of the Hi-Low game from a smaller lab before. Which is why the code was seemed more interactive and more satisfying to work with.
